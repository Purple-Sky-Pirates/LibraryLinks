# Observations
## Week 2

1. Opportunity to describe the Goal -> Feature -> Experiment approach
2. Could be more impactful by taking a firm lead of the experience:
  - 'We’d like to share with you what we’ve been investing in, how it has helped us progress towards our goals and vision, and what we think could make it even better for us...'
3. Deliver the messages with more confidence: how can the team do this?
4. Be more considerate of remote attendees and give everyone the best experience possible (speak up, face the microphone, speak one at a time)
5. Would the navigation chart help facilitate the playback if it traced the journey?
6. At times turned from a playback to a training session (e.g. presenters talking about flow)
7. Great how others in the team supported the delivery of the messages (esp. S filling in alongside J and A contributing)
8. Would the experience be even better if every member of the team (who is present) took a chapter /theme of the story each?
9. Could the stakeholder participants provide the team with more value?
  - Give specific feedback on certain aspects of the story. I.e. we did this and found that… Do you think it would be valuable for us to continue in this direction or to pivot? If pivot, towards what?
10. Other ideas for goals, features and experiments 
11. Be more demanding:
  - What does the team need or want from the academy delivery team to make it even better?
  - What’s needed from stakeholders?
  - What's in it for me?
12. Share your highly ambitious big bets - get other people excited for you
13. “What are we going to have at the end of 6 weeks that we wouldn’t have had without the academy”
